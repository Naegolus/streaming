Today the processing power of multiple computer systems is used to compute
complex problems in various fields of science.
Yet such systems can't be adjusted to more specified and individual problems.

This thesis treats the development of a flexible and extendable computer system,
which makes it possible to adapt the system to the needs of a specific
problem with the help of a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) device and
programmable hard- and software components.
This compound of hard and software should also be exchangeable in a fast and
flexible way by an appropriate framework.

The result of this thesis is the concept as well as the hard- and software of
this versatile computer system. The update and alteration of the system via the
Internet is feasible.
However, the hardware modules cannot be activated by software at the moment, but
need a power off-on of the device.
